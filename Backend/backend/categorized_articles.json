                    "Kaja Kallas, the European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief, said on Sunday that the foreign ministers would convene in Brussels on January 27 to probe how the 27-member bloc might approach the issue.",
                    "In Riyadh, she told reporters that the EU wants to see an inclusive government in Syria which shows no signs of \u201cradicalisation\u201d and also respects the rights of women and other groups. The bloc can quickly reverse any openings on the issue of sanctions, she stressed.",
                    "After Sunday\u2019s talks concluded in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia\u2019s foreign minister called for the lifting of sanctions on Syria.",
                    "\u201cWe stressed the importance of lifting unilateral and international sanctions imposed on Syria, as their continuation hinders the aspirations of the Syrian people to achieve development and reconstruction,\u201d Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud said.",

                    "Reporting from Damascus, Al Jazeera\u2019s Mohammad Jamjoom said the \u201csubstantial\u201d Riyadh diplomatic meeting was more focused on sanctions than a December 14 meeting in Jordan\u2019s Aqaba, which was mostly dealing with ensuring entry of humanitarian aid as Syrians feel the adverse effects.",
                    "\u201cThese sanctions that have been in place for so long have made it very difficult to import or export raw goods,\u201d he said.",
                    "\u201cThat means prices are always sky-high when it comes to essential goods, including food and medicines. It also means Syrians can\u2019t bring in much fuel, so there are power outages all the time.\u201d",

                    "\u201cMany of those sanctions were secondary sanctions \u2013 meaning that it wasn\u2019t just US citizens or businesses that will be sanctioned for doing business with Syria, but also other countries or third parties as well.\u201d",

                    "Possible priorities for relief include \u201cthose sanctions that are hindering the building up of a country, access to banking services and all these things\u201d, the EU\u2019s Kallas further told reporters in Riyadh.",
                    "Germany\u2019s Baerbock said on Sunday that sanctions against allies of al-Assad, who \u201ccommitted serious crimes\u201d during the Syrian war, must remain in place.",

                    "A lightning rebel offensive overthrew al-Assad on December 8 and the HTS, which led the advance, set up a caretaker government that appointed al-Shaibani as foreign minister.",
                    "The new administration is anxious to get the sanctions lifted because it has to show people that the revolution has improved their lives, according to Galip Dalay, senior consulting fellow at the London-based Chatham House.",
                    "He told Al Jazeera that until the government can deliver on points emphasised by the Western parties, \u201cany assistance will be quite limited in scope and mostly confined to the humanitarian aspect.",
                    "\u201cWhat Syria needs is much beyond that and consists of massive reconstruction. So far, we don\u2019t see the Western actors showing full commitment before they see some steps in Syria.\u201d",
                    "The Riyadh meeting was the first to include Syria\u2019s new rulers and top Western officials and was led by Saudi Arabia.",

                    "The two cases involve Trump\u2019s alleged mishandling of classified documents after he left the White House and efforts to overturn his 2020 election defeat. Trump was indicted in both cases overseen by Smith.",

                    "The statement on Smith was a footnote in the filing to Cannon as she mulls whether to maintain a hold on the special counsel\u2019s report on two cases.",

Neither case went to trial.",
                    "After Trump defeated Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris in the November 5 election, Smith dropped both cases, citing a longstanding Justice Department rule against prosecuting sitting presidents. In asking courts to dismiss the charges, Smith\u2019s team defended the merits of the cases they had brought, signalling only that Trump\u2019s impending return to the White House made them untenable.",
                    "Smith\u2019s departure is another marker of the collapse of the criminal cases against Trump, which could end without any legal consequences for the incoming president and led to a backlash that helped fuel his political comeback.",
